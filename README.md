## ‚úÖ Phase 1 Sprint Goal (Deadline: Sunday, Sept 21st)

The objective of our first sprint is for each team member to create a basic, functional script for their assigned role.

* **Architect:** Create the GitHub repo, define the project's folder structure, and build the main application skeleton (`main.py`) that shows the overall logic flow.
* **Image Parser:** Create a script that can take an image as input and successfully perform both OCR and AI-driven image description.
* **Document Parser:** Create a script that can take a `.pptx` or `.xlsx` file as input and extract all text.
* **Text Cleanser:** Create a script that can take a string of text and remove basic PII like email addresses and phone numbers.
